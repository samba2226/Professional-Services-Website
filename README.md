•	Forms structured with labels and inputs
•	Clean and accessible markup
CSS
•	Flexbox for layout
•	Media queries for responsiveness
•	Consistent color scheme
•	Reusable styles
JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

Validation is handled entirely on the client side using JavaScript DOM methods to improve user experience.
 **Image Optimization**
•	Images resized before usage
•	Stored in images/ directory
•	Appropriate formats used (JPG/PNG)
•	Reduced loading time and improved performance
